Freedom Fighters of Might & Magic
========

Freedom Fighters of Might & Magic is a strategy/rpg game based on the Heroes of Might & Magic saga. FFMM will be different with its own rules and it won't be a pure clone version.

For now it's in alpha version, is not playable.

me (gentooza), I've just begun using python at work, and seeing how easy is to use it I've started to build a game (the dream of any boring industrial programmer) :-)

everybody is invited to participate and learn!


##Dependencies

I'm using python 3.4 and pygame 1.92 (python 3.4 is the default in my Trisquel 7 GNU/Linux)

I've based the work in the libraries:

* [pygbutton](https://github.com/asweigart/pygbutton) for creating buttons
* [pyganim](https://github.com/asweigart/pyganim) for sprites animation
* [gummworld2](https://bitbucket.org/gummbum/gummworld2/wiki/Home) for a basic game engine, minimap, etc.

##Execute

>python3 main.py
