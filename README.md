Freedom Fighters of Might & Magic
========

Freedom Fighters of Might & Magic is a strategy/rpg game based on the Heroes of Might & Magic saga. FFMM will be different with its own rules and it won't be a pure clone version.

For now it's in alpha version, with only the movement of the hero over the map, with a basic hud.

me (gentooza), I've just begun using python at work, and seeing how easy is to use it I've started to build a game (the dream of any boring industrial programmer) :-)

everybody is invited to participate and learn!


##Dependencies

I'm using for now python 2.7 and pygame 1.91 (migrating to python3 would be necessary)

I've based the work in the libraries:

* [pygbutton](https://github.com/asweigart/pygbutton) for creating buttons
* [pyganim](https://github.com/asweigart/pyganim) for sprites animation
* [gummworld2](https://bitbucket.org/gummbum/gummworld2/wiki/Home) for a basic game engine, minimap, etc.

##Execute

>python2 main.py
