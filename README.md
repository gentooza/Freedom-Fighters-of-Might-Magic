Freedom Fighters of Might & Magic
========

Freedom Fighters of Might & Magic is a strategy/rpg game based on the Heroes of Might & Magic saga. FFMM will be different with its own rules and it won't be a pure clone version.

For now it's in alpha version.

me (gentooza), I've just begun using python at work, and seeing how easy is to use it I've started to build a game (the dream of any boring industrial programmer) :-)

everybody is invited to participate and learn!
